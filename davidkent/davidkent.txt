One of our recent projects:
---------------------------

One of our recent projects was an extension to a family home in Edinburgh, requiring the dismantling of an existing extension and the creation of a larger one.  The client asked for an extension which was in keeping with the house, re-using as much of the existing stone and materials as possible.
